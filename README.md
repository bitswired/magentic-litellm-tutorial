## Overview

This repository hosts a tutorial to help Python developers understand and leverage the Magentic API along with LiteLLM for integrating state-of-the-art language models into their projects. The tutorial is designed to be user-friendly and comprehensive, guiding users through the essentials of setting up, choosing backends, creating prompts, and streamlining interactions with large language models (LLMs).

## Features

- **Simplified Integration**: Learn how to seamlessly add Magentic and LiteLLM capabilities to Python applications.
- **Backend Selection**: Tutorials on choosing and switching between various LLM backends.
- **Advanced Prompt Handling**: Including structured prompts, chat prompts, and the use of decorators for clean and maintainable code.
- **Function Invocation**: Empower your LLM to perform function calls for extended functionality.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Discover how to utilize async support for better performance and responsiveness.
- **Progressive Results**: Implement streaming and object streaming to manage large outputs and provide real-time feedback.
